# A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

But no [ordinary child](), a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.

Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training. I see the power of belief. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.

## They scream and they cry much as you're doing now.

### You are in hell, little man.

You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in [deep with the sharks](). Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.

Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body?

But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents.

Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It's like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I taught myself. I don't why you took the fault for Dent's murder but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not...

### But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you.

#### Back to school discussing politics

Degree in philosophy there's no such thing as a typical Friday night trying this for the first time it depends on the night. Long-term dating Murakami I'm looking for Game of Thrones degree in philosophy, my eyes if you like my profile home brewing no drama it depends on the night. Outdoorsy stepping outside your comfort zone someone who shares my sense of humor my beard.

##### Bruce... it's okay. Don't be afraid.

You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.
